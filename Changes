      left unecessarily

2.44
  - Add add_data method
  - Fix long-standing bug tripped when adding multiple datasets that use the
    same renderer.

    overflowing the drawable area.

2.37

  - Remove default background_color from Plot

2.22
  - Line renderer will now stack if additive attribute is true.

2.21
  - More clever color allocator that attempts to space out colors at even hue
    spacings for predictable color schemes that are more pleasing and contrast
    enough to be easily differentiated.
  - Bump Graphics::Color dep for color allocator test

2.20
  - Remove ghostly " - 5" that was fucking up additive ranges

  - Set a default color on the Axis' brush
  - Document Axis' tick_label_angle
  - Separate Grid's line drawing into two operations so that each brush
    can affect the output
  - Remove color from Grid, use each brush to set range/domain color
    separately
  - Remove some useless code from Plot
  - Add grid_over flag to Clicker.pm to allow grid over/under control
